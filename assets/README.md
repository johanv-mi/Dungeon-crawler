# Ye Olde Dragon Slayer Game

YODSG is a very simple little dungeon crawler game made to look like as though it is running on an old Macintosh Classic II.

## Project

The game was made as part of an introductory JS course at Medieinstitutet in Gothenburg. It is made using vanilla javascript, html, and css.

### About the game

You start out in a medieval castle town and have a few options of where to go. There is a blacksmith where you can pick up a weapon, the castle where the king lives, and the tavern where you can pick up potions.
At the tavern you can choose to venture further out into the forest where goblins roam.

### Features

- Random encounters
- Two weapons with different hit rates
- Goblins
- Very crude art
- A king for saving
